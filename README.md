This is the Mini Store front Project! a small project where my main goal was to build a small Mini-Storefront using the Next.js App Router. 

How to run

Install dependencies with: npm install
Start the project with: npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

This project creates a Mini Store front where clients will be able to : 
- Browse products
- Filter by category and price
- Add items to a cart
- View cart totals
- See product stock update over time
- View loading, error, and empty states
